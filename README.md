# IdleBot

Game concept I am playing with that is an idle game around creating bots to mine for you.

The basic game concept is that you are a sentient AI that has been tasked with returning vital intelligence to your homeworld.  Before you could accomplish your mission, your ship was destroyed.  You have some basic nano with you to help build new bots.  By building up those bots you can build more and more complex components until you can launch from this system towards your home system.

Of course you may end up crashing on another system before you reach your home system and have to repeat this process a few times.


NOTES:

The basic idea is that of an idle game.  You login and give your bots orders.  Things like collect more ore, refine ore, etc.  The rock you are on may not have what you need.  So you may need to go low tech and build a balastic launcher and send bots to a new asteroid / planet nearby to continue collecting elements.

The prestige game mechanic in an idle game usually results in the player resetting their game progress in exchange for a boost in power.  In this game I am thinking that the reset is leaving your current system for another one.  You effectively start over, but maybe you took more elements, raw material, etc with you and start out much faster.

The grind portion of this is that not all systems have the materials you need.  You may have to hit many, many systems before you can build all the components you need to launch back to your home system.


Decay of the bots over time while user is offline is a concept I want to play with to see how well that works for a motivator to return.  Maybe the bots need you to recharge or repair them at certain points.

We can also use the force that originally blew up your ship as a reason for bots being lost, or as a forcing function to require you to move on to another solar system.
