# IdleBot

Game concept I am playing with that is an idle game around creating bots to mine for you.
The basic game concept is that you are a sentient AI that has been tasked with returning vital intelligence to your homeworld.  Before you could accomplish your mission, your ship was destroyed.  You have some basic nano with you to help build new bots.  By building up those bots you can build more and more complex components until you can launch from this system towards your home system.
Of course you may end up crashing on another system before you reach your home system and have to repeat this process a few times.
